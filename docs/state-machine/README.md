# Spring State Machine Analysis Report

## Overview

This directory contains a comprehensive analysis of Spring State Machine usage in the Syndicated Loan Management System. The investigation focuses on understanding how state management is implemented across different bounded contexts and whether the State Machine is being utilized effectively or if individual services have fallen back to ad-hoc implementations.

## Background

The project has introduced Spring State Machine to control state transitions across bounded contexts. However, there are concerns that the State Machine may not be properly utilized, and individual services might be implementing their own state management logic instead of leveraging the centralized state machine configuration.

## Investigation Scope

### Entities Under Analysis
- **Facility**: DRAFT → FIXED state transitions
- **Loan**: DRAFT → ACTIVE → OVERDUE → COMPLETED lifecycle
- **Party**: ACTIVE → RESTRICTED access control
- **Transaction**: PENDING → PROCESSING → COMPLETED workflow

### Key Questions
1. Is Spring State Machine properly configured and used across all contexts?
2. Are state transitions handled consistently through the State Machine API?
3. Are there bypasses or direct status field modifications?
4. How effective is the cross-bounded-context state coordination?
